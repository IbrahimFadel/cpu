# CPU

A 16 bit CPU made with verilog

- 16 bit address bus
- 4 general purpose 16 bit registers
- 8 bit data bus for loading external data (from ROM/RAM)
- 16 bit internal data bus for intermediate state and stuff

Eventually I want to test it with an FPGA and maybe if everything works out and i have enough time, print it on a PCB and solder it all at the transistor level
